# Dance-mat.js: A DDR controller running on Raspberry Pi using the [Bare Conductive Picap](https://github.com/BareConductive/node-picap)

## Getting up and running

Once you've [got the hardware up and running](https://www.bareconductive.com/make/setting-up-pi-cap-raspberry-pi-zero/), you need to clone the project on the Raspberry Pi, and install dependencies:

    $ npm install

With this done, start up the program:

    $ node dance-mat.js
